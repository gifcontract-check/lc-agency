The `/users/{userId}` collection will store user profiles.  No denormalization is needed, as the application focuses primarily on presentation and contact initiation, with minimal data management. This structure ensures authorization independence and supports the necessary query capabilities (QAPs) for user retrieval and management, if those become relevant later."
